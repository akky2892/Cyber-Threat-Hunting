# Cyber-Threat-Hunting
Information about most important hunts which can be performed by Threat hunters while searching for any adversary/threats inside the organisation.

This will be an one stop for all Threat hunting hunts which are previously discovered as well as new hunts released on day-today basis.
Based on new research by security researchers, list will be continuously updated. These hunts are useful for Threat hunter to perfrom search queries depending on whichever tools you use.

This also includes some of the hunts created by me @Akky2892 based on my research and understanding.

Happy Hunting !!!
