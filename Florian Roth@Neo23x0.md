The SIGMA Project

Florian Roth @Neo23x0 has created a great project for all the blue teamers in the form of Sigma rules. Sigma rules are parallely mapped to Att&ck Mitre Framework which is a Goldmine for all Threat Hunters.
Threat Hunter can refer to these Sigma rules which can be useful in their hunts depending on the tools used to perform hunting.
